# 837 Track Changes Of Product Prices

This workflow monitors product prices on various websites, updates a local JSON file with the latest prices, and sends email notifications when a better price is found.

Example: A user could use this workflow to track the prices of sports equipment, such as soccer cleats, across multiple online retailers. The workflow would regularly check the prices, update a local file with the latest information, and send an email notification if a lower price is detected for a product the user is interested in.

## What You Can Do
- Automated price monitoring: The workflow uses a cron trigger to check product prices at regular intervals.
- Price comparison and updates: The workflow compares the current price to the previously saved price and updates the local file accordingly.
- Email notifications: The workflow sends email notifications when a better price is found, providing the user with the updated price and a link to the product.
