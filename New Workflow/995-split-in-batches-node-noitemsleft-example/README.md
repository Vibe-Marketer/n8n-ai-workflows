# 995 Split In Batches Node Noitemsleft Example

This workflow generates a set of 10 items, splits them into batches of 1, and checks if there are any items left to process, displaying a "No Items Left" message if the batch is empty.

Example: This workflow could be used to process a large dataset in smaller batches, allowing for more efficient handling of the data. For example, it could be used to process customer orders, where each batch represents a set of orders to be processed.

## What You Can Do
- Generates a set of 10 items using a Function node
- Splits the items into batches of 1 using the SplitInBatches node
- Checks if there are any items left to process using the IF node, and displays a "No Items Left" message if the batch is empty
