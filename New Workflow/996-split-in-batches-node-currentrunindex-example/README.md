# 996 Split In Batches Node Currentrunindex Example

This workflow generates a set of 10 items, splits them into batches of 1, and checks if the current batch index is equal to 5, at which point it sets a "Loop Ended" message.

Example: This workflow could be used to process a set of data in batches, with the ability to perform specific actions based on the current batch index. For example, it could be used to send email notifications or trigger other downstream processes when a certain batch is processed.

## What You Can Do
- Generates a set of 10 items using a Function node
- Splits the items into batches of 1 using the SplitInBatches node
- Checks the current batch index using an IF node and sets a "Loop Ended" message when the index is 5
