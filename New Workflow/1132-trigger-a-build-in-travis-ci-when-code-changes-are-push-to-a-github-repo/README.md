# 1132 Trigger A Build In Travis Ci When Code Changes Are Push To A Github Repo

This workflow automatically triggers a Travis CI build when a new pull request is opened or a push event occurs in the n8n repository.

Example: This workflow could be used by the n8n development team to automatically trigger a CI build whenever a new change is pushed or a pull request is opened in the n8n repository, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and any issues are caught early in the development process.

## What You Can Do
- Monitors the n8n repository on GitHub for push and pull request events
- Triggers a Travis CI build when a new pull request is opened or a push event occurs
- Includes a fallback "NoOp" node to handle any events that don't match the specified conditions

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
