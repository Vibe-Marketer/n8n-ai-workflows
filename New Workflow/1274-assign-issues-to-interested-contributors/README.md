# 1274 Assign Issues To Interested Contributors

This workflow automatically assigns GitHub issues to the issue creator or the commenter who requests to work on the issue, helping to streamline issue management and collaboration.

Example: A software development team using GitHub for project management can set up this workflow to automatically assign new issues to the creator or a team member who volunteers to work on the issue, reducing manual task assignment and improving issue tracking.
