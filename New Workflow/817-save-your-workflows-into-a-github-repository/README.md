# 817 Save Your Workflows Into A Github Repository

This workflow automatically backs up and synchronizes n8n workflows to a GitHub repository, detecting and handling changes to ensure consistency.

Example: A team using n8n for their workflow automation needs can use this workflow to regularly (e.g., daily) backup their n8n workflows to a GitHub repository. This ensures that their workflows are version-controlled and can be easily shared, restored, or updated across the team.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic daily backup of n8n workflows to a GitHub repository
- Intelligent detection of changes, allowing for seamless updates or creation of new workflow files
- Flexible configuration of the GitHub repository details (owner, name, path) through the "Globals" node

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
